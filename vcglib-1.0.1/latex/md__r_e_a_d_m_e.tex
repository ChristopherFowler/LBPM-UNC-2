The $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+\+Visualization and Computer Graphics Library\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$ (V\+C\+Glib for short) is a open source, portable, C++, templated, no dependency, library for manipulation, processing, cleaning, simplifying triangle meshes.

The library, composed by more than 100k lines of code, is released under the G\+PL license, and it is the base of most of the software tools of the \href{http://vcg.isti.cnr.it}{\texttt{ Visual Computing Lab}} of the Italian National Research Council Institute I\+S\+TI , like Mesh\+Lab, metro and many others.

The V\+CG library is tailored to mostly manage triangular meshes\+: The library is fairly large and offers many state of the art functionalities for processing meshes, like\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item high quality quadric-\/error edge-\/collapse based simplfication,
\item efficient spatial query structures (uniform grids, hashed grids, kdtree, ...) ,
\item advanced smoothing and fairing algorithms,
\item computation of curvature,
\item optimization of texture coordinates,
\item Hausdorff distance computation,
\item geodesic paths,
\item mesh repairing capabilities,
\item isosurface extraction and advancing front meshing algorithms,
\item Poisson Disk sampling and other tools to sample point distributions over meshes,
\item subdivision surfaces

A number of applications have been developed using the vcglib\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mesh\+Lab\+: the renowed open source mesh processing is based on this library.
\item Metro, the tool for measuring differences between meshes
\item The first high quality out-\/of-\/core mesh simplifier that was used by the Stanford Digital Michelangelo project to process their huge 3D scanned models.
